Instructions: 
(a) Open any data table first in JMP.

The display uses the standard Oneway layout but not the actual Oneway 
platform. You can grab any data point and drag it vertically. You can 
demonstrate this concept with any data table as long as the variable 
for X is reasonable (i.e., nominal with few levels).
