Git Example
-----------


This assignment builds off of the previous [unix command line example](https://github.com/jattenberg/PDS-Spring-2014/blob/master/examples/unix_example_script.md).

1. Create a repo on github for in class examples, clone this to your laptop.
2. In this repo, make a subfolder for the unix example.
3. Copy the scripts containing the unix commands for the previous example into this folder, one file per question. Similarly, make one file per response.
4. Push all the files to the origin master branch. Note the url of the sub-folder containing the unix work.
