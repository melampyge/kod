Example: Simple Data Processing in Python
-----------------------------------------

Please download student skill survey results [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jattenberg/PDS-Spring-2014/master/data/survey_anon.txt). Use the unix wget or curl utility. The file is in a tab-separated data format, the rows of this data correspond to: 

student_id, command line experience, relational database experience, programming experience

Use python for all questions

1. How many students took the survey?
2. How many students have no experience working with the terminal? How many don't even know what terminal experience means? How many students have more than zero experience?
3. How many students have never programmed before? 
4. What are the unique responses to the question on database skills? 
5. For students with more than no programming experience, what is the distribution of database skills? (the # of students with each skill level)
6. For students with each level of programming experience, what is the distribution of database skills? Do this in a single pass over the data.
