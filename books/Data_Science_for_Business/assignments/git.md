Git Assignment: PDS Spring 2014
-------------------------------


This assignment builds off of the assignment using the [unix command line](https://github.com/jattenberg/PDS-Spring-2014/blob/master/assignments/unix.md).

1. Create a repo on github for PDS assignments, clone this repo on your laptop
2. In this repo, make a sub-folder for the unix assignment. You will make sub-folders for all other class assignments.
3. Write program files with your unix commands used to find the answers in the previous assignment, one file per question. Similarly, make one file per response. For instance, you may have: question_1.sh and question_1_response.txt, containing the script and response for the first question.

4. Push all the files to the origin master branch. Post to NYU classes the link to this unix assignment folder.
