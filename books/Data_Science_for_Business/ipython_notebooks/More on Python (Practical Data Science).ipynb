This means python allows a programmer to define special custom data structures called classes that not only can contain their own data elements, but special fucntions called methods that can potentially alter a class instance's internal state. \n",

      "Classes are defined through the keyword `class`, followed by the name of the class, which, by convention, is capitalized. This is followed by a code block that specifies the methods that define a class. Note that classes are a rich and complex topic in python. However, much of the functionality a data scientist may wish to use, in particular, python's machine learning libraries, will be accessed through class objects. Please see the [official documentation](http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/classes.html) for more info."

These constructor functions are invoked by calling the class name as if you were calling a function, that is, using the class name with parentheses afterwards.\n",

A programmer can define their own constructor function, defining any actions that are performed when building a new class object, and data that are used internally within a class object. Like all functions, constructors can take arguments that can be used during their execution. Like methods in a class, the constructor definition takes the special `self` parameter as the left most argument in it's definition. This allows you to modify the internal state of the class object being constructed. Here is an example class with a custom constructor.
