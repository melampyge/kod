The data are taken from the National Longitudinal Survey (NLS Youth Sample) and 
contain observations on 545 males for the years 1980-1987. The variables are in 
alphabetical order, except for the first two which indicate the NLS individual 
identification number and the year of observation. The observations are ordered 
first by individual and second by period. The variables are saved in column space 
delimited format. Each line in the file contains one observation (NR, YEAR). 

These data are also used Vella and Verbeek (1998).
